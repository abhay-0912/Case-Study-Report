## Overview
This case study analyses the lifecycle of BreachForums, law-enforcement actions leading to its takedown, and the displacement of threat actors onto Telegram. The report combines timeline reconstruction, technical analysis of platform migration, observed criminal patterns on Telegram, and implications for law enforcement and defenders.

## Key Findings
- Centralised takedowns (e.g., BreachForums) disrupt operations but do not eliminate illicit activity.
- Telegram provides an attractive mix of encryption, scalability, and automation that supports rapid criminal migration.
- Threat actors rapidly adapt by decentralising tooling (bots, channel networks) and using layering techniques to preserve anonymity.
- Effective long-term mitigation requires coordinated technical, legal, and policy responses, and improved OSINT/forensics capabilities on encrypted platforms.
